This changes, however, with the arrival of a mysterious enemy named Raditz who presents himself as Gokuu's long-lost brother. He reveals that Gokuu is a warrior from the once powerful but now virtually extinct Saiyan race, whose homeworld was completely annihilated. When he was sent to Earth as a baby, Gokuu's sole purpose was to conquer and destroy the planet; but after suffering amnesia from a head injury, his violent and savage nature changed, and instead was raised as a kind and well-mannered boy, now fighting to protect others.\n\n\nWith his failed attempt at forcibly recruiting Gokuu as an ally, Raditz warns Gokuu's friends of a new threat that's rapidly approaching Earth—one that could plunge Earth into an intergalactic conflict and cause the heavens themselves to shake. A war will be fought over the seven mystical dragon balls, and only the strongest will survive in Dragon Ball Z.\n\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>\n                        <td id=\"T_ea89e_row0_col2\" class=\"data row0 col2\" ><a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/813/Dragon_Ball_Z\">https://myanimelist.net/anime/813/Dragon_Ball_Z</a></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                        <th id=\"T_ea89e_level0_row1\" class=\"row_heading level0 row1\" >document_1035</th>\n                        <td id=\"T_ea89e_row1_col0\" class=\"data row1 col0\" >Dragon Ball Kai</td>\n                        <td id=\"T_ea89e_row1_col1\" class=\"data row1 col1\" >Five years after the events of Dragon Ball, martial arts expert Gokuu is now a grown man married to his wife Chi-Chi, with a four-year old son named Gohan. While attending a reunion on Turtle Island with his old friends Master Roshi, Krillin, Bulma and others, the festivities are interrupted when a humanoid alien named Raditz not only reveals the truth behind Gokuu's past, but kidnaps Gohan as well.\n\n\nWith Raditz displaying power beyond anything Gokuu has seen before, he is forced to team up with his old nemesis, Piccolo, in order to rescue his son. But when Gokuu and Piccolo reveal the secret of the seven mystical wish-granting Dragon Balls to Raditz, he informs the duo that there is more of his race, the Saiyans, and they won’t pass up an opportunity to seize the power of the Dragon Balls for themselves.\n\n\nThese events begin the saga of Dragon Ball Kai, a story that finds Gokuu and his friends and family constantly defending the galaxy from increasingly more powerful threats. Bizarre, comical, heartwarming and threatening characters come together in a series of battles that push the powers and abilities of Gokuu and his friends beyond anything they have ever experienced.</td>\n                        <td id=\"T_ea89e_row1_col2\" class=\"data row1 col2\" ><a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6033/Dragon_Ball_Kai\">https://myanimelist.net/anime/6033/Dragon_Ball_Kai</a></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                        <th id=\"T_ea89e_level0_row2\" class=\"row_heading level0 row2\" >document_401</th>\n                        <td id=\"T_ea89e_row2_col0\" class=\"data row2 col0\" >Dragon Ball Super: Broly</td>\n                        <td id=\"T_ea89e_row2_col1\" class=\"data row2 col1\" >Forty-one years ago on Planet Vegeta, home of the infamous Saiyan warrior race, King Vegeta noticed a baby named Broly whose latent power exceeded that of his own son. Believing that Broly's power would one day surpass that of his child, Vegeta, the king sends Broly to the desolate planet Vampa. Broly's father Paragus follows after him, intent on rescuing his son. However, his ship gets damaged, causing the two to spend years trapped on the barren world, unaware of the salvation that would one day come from an unlikely ally.\n\n\nYears later on Earth, Gokuu Son and Prince Vegeta—believed to be the last survivors of the Saiyan race—are busy training on a remote island. But their sparring is interrupted when the appearance of their old enemy Frieza drives them to search for the last of the wish-granting Dragon Balls on a frozen continent. Once there, Frieza shows off his new allies: Paragus and the now extremely powerful Broly. A legendary battle that shakes the foundation of the world ensues as Gokuu and Vegeta face off against Broly, a warrior without equal whose rage is just waiting to be unleashed.\n\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>\n                        <td id=\"T_ea89e_row2_col2\" class=\"data row2 col2\" ><a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36946/Dragon_Ball_Super__Broly\">https://myanimelist.net/anime/36946/Dragon_Ball_Super__Broly</a></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                        <th id=\"T_ea89e_level0_row3\" class=\"row_heading level0 row3\" >document_1469</th>\n                        <td id=\"T_ea89e_row3_col0\" class=\"data row3 col0\" >Dragon Ball Z Special 1: Tatta Hitori no Saishuu Kessen</td>\n                        <td id=\"T_ea89e_row3_col1\" class=\"data row3 col1\" >Bardock, Son Goku's father, is a low-ranking Saiyan soldier who was given the power to see into the future by the last remaining alien on a planet he just destroyed.

This changes, however, with the arrival of a mysterious enemy named Raditz who presents himself as Gokuu's long-lost brother. He reveals that Gokuu is a warrior from the once powerful but now virtually extinct Saiyan race, whose homeworld was completely annihilated. When he was sent to Earth as a baby, Gokuu's sole purpose was to conquer and destroy the planet; but after suffering amnesia from a head injury, his violent and savage nature changed, and instead was raised as a kind and well-mannered boy, now fighting to protect others.\n\n\nWith his failed attempt at forcibly recruiting Gokuu as an ally, Raditz warns Gokuu's friends of a new threat that's rapidly approaching Earth—one that could plunge Earth into an intergalactic conflict and cause the heavens themselves to shake. A war will be fought over the seven mystical dragon balls, and only the strongest will survive in Dragon Ball Z.\n\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>\n                        <td id=\"T_76ae5_row2_col2\" class=\"data row2 col2\" ><a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/813/Dragon_Ball_Z\">https://myanimelist.net/anime/813/Dragon_Ball_Z</a></td>\n                        <td id=\"T_76ae5_row2_col3\" class=\"data row2 col3\" >0.067677</td>\n            </tr>\n    </tbody></table>"

Once there, Frieza shows off his new allies: Paragus and the now extremely powerful Broly. A legendary battle that shakes the foundation of the world ensues as Gokuu and Vegeta face off against Broly, a warrior without equal whose rage is just waiting to be unleashed.\n\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>\n                        <td id=\"T_5ab15_row0_col2\" class=\"data row0 col2\" ><a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36946/Dragon_Ball_Super__Broly\">https://myanimelist.net/anime/36946/Dragon_Ball_Super__Broly</a></td>\n                        <td id=\"T_5ab15_row0_col3\" class=\"data row0 col3\" >0.655309</td>\n            </tr>\n    </tbody></table>"

We compute these scores taking into account only the year because we think the user is more likely to do a search by remembering only the releasedate or enddate year rather than the exact date with day and month.\n",
    "- the score_staff, score_characters, score_voice: we compute these scores adding 0.5 every time a name in the query appears in the list of strings. We decided to add 0.5 because in this way, if the users only enter the name or the surname of the character/staff/voice the relative score will be 0.5, instead if the users enters both the name and the surname the relative score is equal to 1 (as the similarity is more precise)."
